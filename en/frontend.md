## Introduction

As a software engineer within **dzconseil** team, you have to provide a reliable **frontend** application to clients.
Your task here is to implement a checkout page for a small **Airbnb** like rest api.

## Requirement

1. We value a **clean**, **simple** working solution.
2. Solution must work on all modern browsers (IE excluded).
3. The solution must be written in [React](https://reactjs.org/).
4. The solution must be production ready.
5. Good understanding for how git works.
6. Good understanding of **REST API's** and **Http Clients**.

## Notes

- Source code must be pushed as git branch in the provided project repository. For this challenge we used a [GitHub](https://github.com/dzconseil/frontend-challenge) repo and [Create React App Starter](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
- Your branch name should follow this scheme `challenge/lastname-firstname`.
- (Optional) Deploy as a public api to your own host.

## Expectations

- This challenge should take around **4** to **6** hours to complete.
- Your code should be modular, each module should focus on doing one thing and do it well.

- Be cautious of **third-party** library usage. Don't include a 300KB library only for 1 helper function.

## Problem Statement

The web is quickly evolving and most of companies are switching their projects from jQuery-ish apps to single page **React** apps.
At **dzconseil** we work a lot with this type of **Want to migrate** clients.

As a frontend engineer **Your Mission, Should You Choose To Accept It** ðŸ’» is to build a checkout page,
with at most 4 components for an **Airbnb** like website, where hosts can list their homes for rent,
and guests later can visit our website and book this homes for a specific duration called **Trip Duration**. [See Wireframe](#interface)

### Interface

_For reference only, you can be creative with design and UI/UX features._
